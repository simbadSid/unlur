	<string name = "step0Rules">During the first step, both players put black pawns. The edges of the ground are not accessible.\nThis step ends when a player clicks on the \"Next Step\" button. This player becomes the \"black player\".  The other one becomes the \"white player\"</string>
	<string name = "step1Rules">The \"white player\" must make a line between two opposite edges.\nThe black player must make a Y shape between three disjoint edges.\nThe winner is the first player who achieves his aim.</string>
	<string name = "historyAndExplanationText">The \"Unlur\" is an abstract combinatorial strategy game for two players.\nThe game was invented by <b>Jorge Gómez Arrausi</b> in the competition game \"2001 Annual Game Design Competition\", themed \"unequal strength games\".\nThe \"Un\" of the game name comes from \"unequal forces\".\nTo have no null game, a player loses if he reaches the opponent\'s goal without reaching the same time his own goal. This rule allows the \"White player\" to change his strategy from \"I need to connect two opposite sides\" to \"I try to force Black to connect two opposite sides\" highlighting the subtleties of the game.</string>
